Commands
## SAVE "filepath"

This command will save the current program to the file system.  The program will be written as a text file, not in binary format (as old BASIC's did back in the day).  This command does not doing any checking, either on the program or on the destination.  You will get an error only if the file can't be saved, but otherwise you won't get any error or warning, such as on overwriting an existing file.
